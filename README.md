# Alpine Eagles E-bike MTB Club

This `README.md` provides an overview of the Alpine Eagles E-bike MTB Club website, its features, testing, deployment, and credits. This document will allow assessors, collaborators, and potential clients to understand the project and how to use it.

## Project Overview

The Alpine Eagles E-bike MTB Club website promotes e-mountain bike tours in the Bavarian Alps. It targets both experienced and new e-bikers interested in exploring the region's trails. The site provides information about the club, its services, scheduled tours, and a way to join the community. The goal of this project is to attract new members to the club by showing them the beauty of e-biking in the Bavarian Alps.

## Balsamiq Wireframes

Balsamiq wireframes are low-fidelity, hand-drawn style digital sketches of the Alpine Eagles website's layout used to plan the user interface. Balsamiq was chosen for its ability to quickly create and iterate on visual layouts, allowing for rapid design decisions and modifications.
